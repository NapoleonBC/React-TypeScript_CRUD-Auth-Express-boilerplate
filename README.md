# React-TypeScript CRUD + Authentication + Express Boilerplate

This repository provides a boilerplate setup for building a simple web application with a frontend built using React and TypeScript, along with a backend powered by Express. The boilerplate includes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality and authentication features.

## Features

- **Frontend**:
  - React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.
  - CRUD Operations: Basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing data.
  - User Interface: A simple yet customizable user interface to interact with the backend API.

- **Backend**:
  - Express: A flexible and minimal web application framework for Node.js.
  - Authentication: Token-based authentication for securing routes and managing user sessions.
  - API Endpoints: Defined routes for handling CRUD operations and user authentication.
  - MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and managing application data.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/techguru0/React-TypeScript_CRUD-Auth-Express-boilerplate.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd React-TypeScript_CRUD-Auth-Express-boilerplate
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Configure the backend:
   - Rename the `backend/.env.example` file to `backend/.env`.
   - Update the MongoDB connection string and any other environment variables in the `.env` file.

### Usage

1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
